This is a survey application I have designed during my internship and it is designed for android 2.2 .
It is a basic app in android with some sqlite action and it consists of several multiple choice questions linked one by one. These questions have multiple options ranging from 2 to 8. 

Guys who are beginner in android can take help of this so to proceed further in android world... ;)
Feel free to use it and take the most of it... :)
